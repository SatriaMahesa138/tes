            It is located on a cliff with an elongated hill that juts out towards the sea and looks like a little finger. The view of Kelingking Beach from above is the exotic view of Tebing Paluang, or also called Karang Dewa.
            Kelingking Paluang is the name of a temple which is located not far from this place, while Karang Desa is the name of the local village. This part of the cliff is often a photo spot because of its unique shape. The cliffs create a depression into the beach.

            Iconic beach with views of coral rocks that collapse to form a circle above sea level.
As the name suggests, Broken Beach has an imperfect beach view. However, imperfection is what makes this beach interesting.
The panorama of this beach is truly amazing. Starting from the blue sea water, surrounded by coral rocks, and one part of the coral forms a silhouette like a tunnel above the sea water.
