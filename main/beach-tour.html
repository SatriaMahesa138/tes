            This temple, which is located at the southwest tip of the island of Bali on a steep and high rock platform jutting out into the sea, is the Sad Kayangan Temple which is believed by Hindus to be a buffer from the 9 winds. This temple was originally used as a place to worship a holy priest from the 11th century named Empu Kuturan. He handed down the teachings of the Traditional Village with all its rules.
